# Breakout-Game

A breakout minigame, my first step in the videogame industry done with Digital Bros Academy.
In this minigame you will control the paddle and try to keep the ball alive while breaking the blocks.

# Bonus Features
Aside from the base game done as a tutorial, I added some features on my own such as:

- A combo system that keeps track of how many blocks the ball hits without ever falling and multiplies the score by that;
- A powerup/malus system, after breaking a block there is a small chance to spawn a powerup or a malus that will increase/decrease the paddle size for 5 seconds or spawning a new ball;
- A difficulty selector in the start screen that will make the ball move slower/faster;

# To-do Features
This are the features I want to develop next:

- Randomly spawn the blocks and keep spawning them as long as the player has lives;
- More powerups/malus;
